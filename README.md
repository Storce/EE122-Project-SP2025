# EE122-Project-SP2025
Research Project for EE122, by Veronica Cheung, Joe Wang, and Albert Ye

This research project aims to evaluate performance improvements through load balancing using NGINX in a simulated containerized environment. By deploying NGINX as a load balancer across multiple Docker containers, the study will compare different load balancing methods in the context of a containerized cloud environment. Performance will be quantified using key metrics like CPU usage, RAM consumption, and response time.
